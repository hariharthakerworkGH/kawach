# Kawach

Manual entry, categories, a dashboard (net position, things needing
attention, upcoming bills), statement import for three issuers so far, a
Transactions screen for categorizing and editing anything, and an Accounts
screen that projects your next credit card bill from spend since the last
import. Works fully offline once installed.

## Parsers supported so far
- `js/parsers/hdfc-bank-savings.js` - HDFC Bank savings statements, the
  mailed/emailed "combined statement" template
- `js/parsers/hdfc-bank-savings-netbanking.js` - the **same** HDFC savings
  account, but the self-service "Statement of Account" export from
  NetBanking - a completely different template (2-digit years, an extra
  reference-number column, no explicit "0.00" for whichever of
  withdrawal/deposit didn't happen, so direction is inferred from how the
  running balance moved rather than which column has a value). The same
  bank can export more than one statement layout depending on where you
  downloaded it from - each one needs its own parser, they aren't
  interchangeable even for the identical account.
- `js/parsers/hdfc-credit-card.js` - HDFC Bank credit card statements (any
  co-branded card on HDFC's own template - Swiggy, Rewards, UPI RuPay, etc.)
- `js/parsers/icici-amazon-pay-credit-card.js` - ICICI Bank Amazon Pay card

Each new statement template needs its own parser module added to
`js/parsers/registry.js`, even when it's the same bank and account you've
already got a parser for. Give me a real statement PDF and I'll build it the
same way - parse, then verify the totals reconcile against the statement's
own figures (not just the closing balance - counts and sums per direction
too) before trusting it.

## Manual entries against any account, and statement reconciliation
The Add screen lets you log a manual entry against any account, not just
Cash - including a credit card, before that month's statement even exists.
When you later import that card's statement, `js/reconciliation.js` matches
statement rows against your manual entries (same account, amount, and date
within 3 days): a match replaces the manual entry with the statement's own
data (keeping whatever category you'd already set), and anything left
unmatched shows up in two places - manual entries the statement didn't
confirm are listed on the import screen so you can double-check them, and
statement rows you hadn't logged by hand are just new transactions to
categorize in Transactions. This is how you catch recurring auto-payments you
forgot about.

## Billing cycles
Every card account has a `billingCycleDay` (the day of month its statement
closes) - set automatically from the first statement you import, or by hand
from the Accounts screen (tap "Set billing cycle day"). `js/billing-cycle.js`
uses it to figure out the currently-open cycle even before any statement
exists for that card, so manual entries you log right after getting a card
still land in the right cycle for the spend projection.

## Credit card bill payments and double-counting
When both a bank and a card statement are imported, a debit in the bank
account paying off the card bill and a matching "payment received" credit
in the card account both represent the same money moving - not two separate
expenses. `js/transfers.js` auto-flags same-amount pairs within 5 days
across accounts as transfers, and Summary excludes them from spend totals.
You can flag/unflag any transaction by hand from the Transactions screen.

## Merchant matching (auto-categorization)
`js/merchant-rules.js` extracts a handful of "significant" words from a
description (stripping payment-gateway noise like `PAY*`/`PTM*`/`RSP*`,
value-date/ref boilerplate, and generic connector words) and matches on
word overlap rather than one exact key. That's what lets `PAY*SWIGGY
FOODBANGALORE`, `PTM*SWIGGY INBANGALORE`, and `SwiggyBENGALURU` all hit the
same rule even though the same merchant shows up differently across payment
gateways. It can't unify a merchant whose statement name shares literally no
words with the one you categorized (e.g. Swiggy trading as "BUNDL
TECHNOLOGIES" for some orders) - that needs a hand-curated alias table,
which isn't built.

## Recurring bills ("Upcoming" on the dashboard)
`js/recurring.js` scans debit history for the same merchant recurring
roughly monthly (25-36 days apart) at a roughly stable amount (within 15%),
and surfaces detected bills with a projected next due date. Detections are
upserted into the `recurring` store, so dismissing one ("Not recurring")
sticks - it won't get re-flagged next time the dashboard recomputes this.
It's a heuristic, not a guarantee: needs at least 2 occurrences, and a
brand-new bill won't show up until its second charge.

## Anomaly flags ("Needs your attention" on the dashboard)
`js/anomalies.js` flags two things among this month's debits: a spend at a
merchant meaningfully larger than that merchant's own history (average +
2 standard deviations, or 1.5x average, whichever is higher), and a
first-ever spend at a new merchant above ₹1,000. Both thresholds are
arbitrary starting points in the source file, not tuned against real data -
adjust them if they're too noisy or too quiet for how you actually spend.

## Try it locally
ES modules need a real server, not double-clicking `index.html`. From this
folder:
```
py -m http.server 5173
```
Then open `http://localhost:5173` in a browser.

## Publish to GitHub Pages
Same as Signal: push this folder to a GitHub repo and enable Pages on it
(Settings → Pages → deploy from the `main` branch, root folder). Then open
that URL on your phone and use "Add to Home Screen" to install it as a PWA.

## One thing to remember when you come back for changes
`sw.js` caches the app shell so it works offline. Every time a file changes,
bump the `CACHE_NAME` constant at the top of `sw.js` (e.g. `v1` → `v2`) or
your phone will keep showing the old cached version after you reload.

## Note on account types
The data model says account `type` is `bank|card`. Phase 1 seeds a default
`Cash` account with `type: "cash"` so manual entries have somewhere to
attach - this is a small extension beyond the original spec, done because
manual entries need an account and there's no cash type otherwise.

## Currency symbol and formatting
Symbol is set in `js/config.js` (`CURRENCY_SYMBOL`), defaults to ₹. All
amounts are formatted through `js/format.js`, which uses `Intl.NumberFormat`
with the `en-IN` locale so large numbers group the Indian way (₹12,34,567.89)
instead of the Western way (₹1,234,567.89).

## Credit card bills
Card statements carry the two numbers that actually matter - total amount
due and payment due date - so both parsers extract them and store them on
the account (`statementDue`, `statementMinDue`, `statementDueDate`). The
Accounts screen leads with what's owed and how many days are left, colouring
it when it's due within three days or overdue; the dashboard sums unpaid
bills into "Card bills due". Unbilled spend since the last statement is
shown underneath as the secondary number, because it isn't owed yet.

"Mark as paid" is manual - the app can't reliably tell whether a bank debit
was for this specific card. Importing a newer statement supersedes the old
bill and resets the flag automatically.

## Backup and restore
`js/backup.js` exports every store as JSON, encrypted with AES-GCM using a
key derived from your passphrase (PBKDF2-SHA256, 210k iterations, random
salt and IV per file). The file is useless without the passphrase - there is
no recovery path, by design. Restore replaces everything. Both live under
the ⚙ button in the header.

This is the only thing standing between you and total data loss: everything
lives in one browser's IndexedDB, so clearing site data or losing the phone
wipes it.

## Duplicate imports and undo
Re-importing a statement you've already loaded would silently double every
row, so the import screen compares incoming rows against existing
statement-sourced transactions on that account (same date, amount,
direction and description), flags the matches, warns that the period
overlaps a previous import, and offers to skip them - checked by default.
Every import is also undoable from ⚙ → Import history, which deletes exactly
the transactions that came from that batch. Manual entries an import
replaced don't come back, and the confirm says so.

## Bank balance
A bank account's balance is a snapshot: the last imported statement's own
closing balance and date (`account.knownBalance` / `knownBalanceDate`),
adjusted forward by anything dated after that. It reads "Balance unknown"
until you import at least one statement for that account.

## PDF parsing
`js/vendor/pdf.min.js` and `pdf.worker.min.js` are pdf.js, downloaded once
and committed here so the app never calls out to a CDN at runtime (per the
no-third-party-calls privacy rule). Password-protected PDFs are supported -
enter the password in the Import screen; it's held in memory only for that
one parse and never written to storage.
